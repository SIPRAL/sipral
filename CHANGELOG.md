# Changelog

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning is semantic once 1.0 exists; before that, minor versions may break.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Phase 1 readiness review, nine gaps closed: WebSocket scoped to phase 2 and
  its framing corrected (one SIP message per WebSocket message, never the
  `Content-Length` framer); keepalive given a home in `EndpointConfig`; the
  `sipral-ua` call handle renamed away from the core's `CallId`; a fuzzing
  plan and a per-flow interoperability pass bar in `docs/11-testing.md`; the
  `sipral` facade crate inheriting version, licence and lints from the
  workspace; `scripts/check.sh` failing on version drift between the
  workspace and the .NET package.
- Design and licensing documents checked claim by claim against the RFC text
  and the primary sources; 20 corrections applied. The ones that change
  behaviour: the release profile no longer sets `panic = "abort"`, because the
  FFI layer has to catch unwinding at the C boundary; `sipral-ffi` and
  `sipral-io-coreaudio` now carry the `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic`/indexing lints
  they were silently missing; phase 1 explicitly includes the minimal RTP and
  G.711 slice a bidirectional call needs; `LICENSING.md` no longer implies that
  charging for a product is by itself what triggers the commercial arm. CI
  installs the toolchain from `rust-toolchain.toml` instead of pinning a second
  time in the workflow, and runs the gitleaks binary (pinned, checksum
  verified) instead of the marketplace action, which requires a paid licence
  on organisation repositories.

### Added

- Workspace skeleton: the eight crates from `docs/01-architecture.md`, each with
  its scope documented and nothing implemented.
- Design documents for phase 0: architecture, clean-room rules, signalling
  core, user agent, media, NAT, headless endpoint, FFI, RFC index, roadmap,
  testing.
- Licensing set: AGPL-3.0-only alongside a commercial arm, with `LICENSING.md`,
  `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md`, `TRADEMARK.md`, `AUTHORS`, `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`,
  and SPDX headers on every source file.
- `deny.toml` with a permissive-only allow-list, enforced in CI.
- `scripts/check.sh`: licence headers, provenance, published-tree language,
  internal files and captures, build, lints, tests, dependency licences,
  secrets.
- CI on Linux, macOS and Windows, plus separate licence and hygiene jobs.
- `sipral-core::msg`: the message layer's foundation. `Span`, `HeaderSlot` and
  a reusable `ParseScratch`; `Method` and `StatusCode`; `RawMessage` as a view
  over the caller's buffer; and a parser that locates the start line, the
  header fields and the body without copying any of them. Folded values are one
  slot with their interior CRLF intact, repeated headers are one slot each in
  wire order, and `Content-Length` frames the body so trailing octets in a
  datagram are ignored. Bounded by a `Limits` struct so a hostile peer cannot
  make it do unbounded work, and written so that no input reaches a panic.
  37 tests, several of them RFC 4475 cases the corpus will assert in full later.
- `sipral-core::msg::HeaderName`: the 38 header fields the stack knows, matched
  whatever their case and in either form. Fifteen compact forms, each read out
  of the RFC that defines it rather than from memory. `RawMessage` gains
  `header`, `header_values`, `header_count` and `header_names`, so asking for
  `Via` finds a `v:` line and asking for an extension is case-insensitive too.
- `sipral-core::msg::UriRef`: SIP URIs in parts, borrowed from the buffer.
  An enum rather than a struct, because only `sip:` and `sips:` have a
  hostport: a `tel:` URI and an unknown scheme are kept whole instead of being
  forced into a shape they do not have. The userinfo boundary is settled before
  parameters or headers are looked for, since `user` may contain `;` and `?`
  unescaped. Parameters and headers are walked on demand, and `unescape`
  handles `%` escapes including `%00`, leaving a stray `%` alone because the
  corpus has one in a message that is valid.
- `sipral-core::msg::lex`: the lexical rules every header value obeys, in one
  place instead of once per field. Unfolding, comma-separated values, and
  `;name=value` parameters, all of which stop at a quoted string or a `<...>`
  URI. `Contact: "Smith, John" <sip:j@x>` is one value; `qop="auth=1,auth-int"`
  is one parameter.
- `sipral-core::msg::OwnedMessage`: the same bytes and header index behind two
  `Arc`s, so a message the stack keeps costs one copy and a clone costs none.
  Bytes past the body are left behind, so a second request sharing a datagram
  is not carried along.
- `sipral-core::msg::scalar`: the fields that carry a number, and `CSeq`, which
  carries one and a method. The separator inside `CSeq` and `RAck` is `LWS`, so
  a fold between the digits and the method still reads. Overflow is two rules,
  not one: a `CSeq` that does not fit in 32 bits is refused, while an `Expires`
  parses and reports that it did not fit, because the RFC lets an element fall
  back to its default there. Nothing is truncated, so a hundred-digit `Expires`
  cannot become a plausible small number.
- `sipral-core::msg::ViaRef`: the field that decides where a response goes.
  `SLASH` and `COLON` absorb surrounding whitespace, so the two slashes are
  located before anything else; `received` carries an IPv6 address without
  brackets, unlike everywhere else, and accepts them anyway because they are
  sent; `ttl` is `1*3DIGIT`, so `;ttl=1234` is not a ttl at all; `rport` has
  three states and `;rport=` is none of them. A `Via` with no branch is an RFC
  2543 peer to be matched per §17.2.3, not a malformed header.
- `sipral-core::msg::NameAddrRef`: `From`, `To` and `Contact`. The angle
  brackets decide who owns the parameters — inside them `;transport=tcp` is on
  the URI, outside them it is on the header field — and RFC 4475 `cparam01` and
  `cparam02` are one address written both ways to catch a stack that cannot
  tell. Whitespace lives outside the brackets, so `< sip:a@b >` is refused; a
  display name is a token run or a quoted string and nothing else, so
  `Bell, Alexander <sip:...>` is refused while `caller<sip:...>` is accepted as
  the documented grammar defect it is; an unterminated quoted string is refused
  rather than guessed at. `Contact: *` is the whole field or nothing.
  `RawMessage` gains `from`, `to`, `contact` and `field_values`, the last
  walking a comma-separated field across its lines and its commas alike.
- `sipral-core::msg::RouteRef`: `Route` and `Record-Route`. A route entry is a
  `name-addr` with no bracket-less alternative, so `Route: sip:p1;lr` is
  refused rather than guessed at — without the `>` there is nothing to say
  where the URI ends. `is_loose_route()` reads `;lr` on the URI and not on the
  header field, because `<sip:p1>;lr` is a strict router carrying a parameter
  that happens to be spelled the same, and getting that backwards sends the
  request to a strict router with a Request-URI it cannot use. Entries come
  back in wire order, never sorted or deduplicated.
- `sipral-core::msg::ChallengeRef` and `CredentialsRef`: digest challenges and
  credentials, as two types rather than one, because `qop` is a quoted comma
  list in a challenge and a bare token in credentials and the RFC's own worked
  example writes both. `realm`, `nonce`, `cnonce`, `username` and `opaque` come
  back unescaped; `uri` and `response` come back exactly as written, since
  neither is a `quoted-string` and a Request-URI is no place to resolve
  backslashes. `response` has no fixed length, per RFC 8760. Each header line
  is one value: RFC 3261 §20.7 and §20.28 exempt these fields from
  comma-joining, and several challenges are several lines in preference order.
- `sipral-core::msg::TokenIter` and `MediaTypeRef`: `Require`, `Proxy-Require`,
  `Supported`, `Unsupported`, `Content-Encoding`, `Accept`, `Allow` and
  `Content-Type`. Option tags are matched without case; methods are not,
  because the six RFC 3261 verbs are fixed-case literals in the grammar and
  `Allow: invite` is an extension method that happens to be spelled like one
  of them.
- `sipral-core::msg::RequestBuilder` and `ResponseBuilder`: writing a message
  out. Deterministic — same inputs, same bytes, whatever order the setters were
  called in — because a retransmission has to be the identical datagram and a
  byte-comparing test is worth nothing otherwise. `Via` goes first, then the
  routing and dialog fields, then whatever else the caller added, then the
  body's two fields; `Content-Length` is always written, since a stream
  transport has no other way to find the end of a message. A response copies
  what RFC 3261 §8.2.6.2 says must be equal, adds a `To` tag only when the
  request carried none, and copies `Record-Route` only when asked, because
  §12.1.1 requires that of a response establishing a dialog and only the
  caller knows whether this is one. No value may hold CR or LF: a header value
  goes out on one line, and a caller's data with a line break in it would
  otherwise write headers of its own.
- `StatusCode::reason`: the reason phrases RFC 3261 §21 registers, plus 422
  from RFC 4028, so nobody has to invent one.
- `RawMessage::transaction_lookup_method`: the key §17 matches on. An ACK
  answers INVITE, since the INVITE server transaction absorbs the ACK to a
  non-2xx and an ACK to a 2xx finds nothing under that key and belongs to the
  dialog; a response answers with its `CSeq` method, having none of its own.
- `crates/sipral`: the facade crate, for now a name reservation on crates.io
  that exports a version constant. The only crate with `publish = true`.
- `bindings/dotnet/Sipral`: the .NET package, for now a name reservation
  published to NuGet as `Sipral` 0.0.1.
- `docs/12-core-api.md`: the public surface of `sipral-core` as signatures,
  merged from four independent proposals scored by three reviewers, with
  register, call, CANCEL-race and fork walkthroughs, a fake-clock test, the C
  projection, and a record of what was rejected and why. Adds the RFC 6026
  `Accepted` state to both INVITE machines, which every proposal had missed on
  the client side.
- RFC 4475 torture corpus under `fixtures/rfc4475/`: the 49 messages decoded
  byte for byte from the archive in Appendix A, laid out by RFC section, with
  a manifest carrying section, title, expected outcome and SHA-256 per file.
  `scripts/check.sh` verifies the hashes so line-ending normalisation cannot
  silently alter a test.
- `SECURITY.md`, pointing at GitHub private vulnerability reporting, and an
  issue template for commercial licence enquiries. No email address appears
  anywhere in the repository, by design: `scripts/check.sh` fails on one, in a
  file or in commit metadata.

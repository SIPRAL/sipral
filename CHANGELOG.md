# Changelog

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning is semantic once 1.0 exists; before that, minor versions may break.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- A request too large for the path now says how large, and the check now covers
  the request that made the trouble. `Event::TransportWanted` carries the size
  of the request that did not fit and the size that would have, so
  "request 1785 bytes, limit 1299" is a line an application can log instead of
  a packet capture nobody took; the reference loop passes the event up as well
  as answering it, which it did not. The limit comes from one place, so the
  number reported and the number the decision was taken on cannot drift.

  Two real faults came out of writing it. The switch to a stream took the first
  TCP transport in the table whatever it was connected to, so a large request
  to one server left over an open connection to another; it now takes only a
  connection to the destination asked for, which is what §18.1.1 recommends and
  the only one that would deliver it. And the check was on the first send only,
  while the request that fragmented in the field was the one carrying
  `Authorization` — three hundred bytes larger than the attempt that had fitted,
  and built by the retry. The retry checks now too.

- A configuration value cannot be accepted and ignored. `SIPRAL_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED`
  is the third answer a setter may give, distinct from a value that is wrong
  and from a struct this build cannot read, and the audit that came with it
  found the failure it was written for: `timer_t2_ms` and `timer_t4_ms` were
  taken without complaint on TCP, TLS and WebSocket transports, where neither
  is ever armed — a setting disabled by a neighbouring one, which is the shape
  the requirement describes. Both are refused where they are set now, naming
  the setting and the transport, as is a T2 below the T1 it caps, which makes
  T1 the value that disappears. An expiry too large for the header it goes in
  is refused at the account rather than by the registrar. `sipral_stack_settings`
  reads back what a stack is actually running on, since a zero in the config
  means "the default" and the effective figure is otherwise unknowable.

### Fixed

- A `Require` this agent cannot honour is refused on every request, not only on
  the INVITE that opens a call. §8.2.2.3 says a UAS, not an INVITE: a re-INVITE,
  an UPDATE, an OPTIONS or a NOTIFY demanding an extension that is not
  implemented cannot be honoured as sent, and answering it as though it could is
  worse than declining — a peer that asked for something and got a 200 believes
  it got it. Writing the test found that the OPTIONS handler answered 200 to
  anything it was handed, including this, because it sat first in the event
  chain; it now runs after the check. Only the tags that are actually unknown
  come back in `Unsupported`, which the section asks for by name.

### Added

- **The C ABI carries media.** It depended on signalling and stopped there, so a
  client on the other side of it parsed its own SDP, ran its own RTP and owned
  its own audio — which is why most of `docs/13-client-requirements.md` was
  waiting on one crate. It now drives the facade's engine, and fourteen entry
  points came with it: the codecs this build contains and the order they are
  offered in, without needing a stack to ask; what a live call agreed, with its
  wire payload type, clocks and keying; recording started and stopped mid-call;
  statistics live and complete at the end; media stopping and coming back; and
  the audio path itself, without which the rest is decoration.

  A call is described one way or the other and never both: give it a media
  address and the stack writes the offer and owns the audio, give it raw SDP and
  it behaves as it always did. Both is refused. A managed call answers its own
  re-offers, so the application is told the media changed rather than asked what
  to do about it.

  The recording's ownership is the part that had to be got right: the file
  belongs to the media session and C never sees a handle, and the WAVE header's
  lengths are patched on all three exits — an explicit stop, the call ending,
  and the stack being destroyed, including when it is destroyed from inside the
  event callback. A file that is never closed is a file that will not play.

  Two of the reserved event numbers were taken in place, which is what they were
  reserved for. Taking them meant letting live and reserved lines interleave in
  one run rather than forcing the live ones into a prefix, since otherwise
  reaching a number meant also spending the ones before it on features that do
  not exist.

  **What this does not yet do, said plainly: a call still cannot be placed
  through this ABI.** There is no transport entry point — `sipral_stack_poll`
  counts what the stack wants to send and discards it — so media I/O is now
  ahead of signalling I/O. That gap predates this change and is next.

- A default profile for the equipment this stack is actually deployed against —
  a softphone behind consumer NAT talking to an Asterisk-family PBX — with what
  each optional mechanism costs on the wire beside it. **Declaring ICE adds 143
  bytes per candidate**, measured and pinned by a test rather than estimated
  into a document that would stop being true, and that is the floor: a laptop
  with Wi-Fi, Ethernet and a VPN writes nine such lines, and an offer carrying
  them no longer fits the 1300-byte datagram floor of RFC 3261 §18.1.1. Which is
  not hypothetical — NAT attributes were four hundred of the bytes in the
  request that fragmented in the field and died in silence, sent to a peer that
  did not speak the protocol at all.
  The document also says the uncomfortable part plainly: ICE is off today
  because nothing links `sipral-nat`, which is the right behaviour reached the
  wrong way. A default that holds only because nobody wired the alternative is
  one that changes the first time somebody does.

- Gain, mute and a level meter on both device crates, and the device that goes
  away mid-call reported rather than turning into silence.

  The gain is applied to the frames here rather than through the platform,
  because none of the platform's volumes belongs to a call: the device volume
  is shared with everything on the machine, the process volume is one setting
  for the whole application, and both outlive the call. Turning a call down
  must not turn a film down. It is applied at the device end of the ring rather
  than the caller's, because the ring holds sixteen frames and a mute heard a
  third of a second after the button is not a mute.

  Both ends of the range are defined: the ratio clamps, the samples saturate
  instead of wrapping, and every sample that lands at the end is counted — so a
  gain set too high is a number beside the slider rather than a mystery
  distortion. A muted direction keeps frames moving, so unmuting does not play
  a backlog.

  The meter is the loudest sample over a tenth of a second, held between one
  window and two. Peak-since-last-poll was rejected because it makes the number
  depend on how often it is read; polling now mutates nothing, so any number of
  callers at any rate see the same answer. It costs one compare per sample,
  folded into the pass the gain already makes.

  A device that disappears mid-call is reported — read from the platform rather
  than inferred from silence — and the stream stops rather than quietly
  producing nothing, so an application that ignores the event finds a stream
  that has plainly stopped. Recovery is one call, carrying the gain and the
  mute across, and is deliberately not automatic: whether to move to the laptop
  speaker, wait, or end the call is not this layer's decision. A saved
  selection is held as the identity that survives a replug, and the
  documentation is explicit that a crate cannot stop the operating system
  changing the default — reopening is what re-applies it.

- An INVITE nobody asked for can be refused before anything sees it. Scanners
  dial common extension numbers at every hour, and a client on a public port
  either filters them or wakes its user at three in the morning. The policy hook
  sits between registration and calls in the event chain, which is the last
  place before the one site that mints a call handle and pushes
  `IncomingCall` — "before any user-visible effect" is the requirement's own
  sentence and it is where the ordering comes from.

  Beneath it, a token bucket per source address — per address rather than per
  socket, since a port costs an attacker nothing to change — in a table bounded
  at sixty-four entries. At the bound a source whose bucket has refilled is
  evicted, holding nothing a new entry would not; if every seat is still
  spending, a stranger is refused rather than admitted untracked, because
  admitting what cannot be limited is a hole exactly when it matters. The
  limiter runs before the hook: calling arbitrary application code at flood rate
  is the second attack.

  Refusals are counted, cumulatively, and are deliberately not an event. An
  event queue anybody on the internet can fill is the same attack one layer up.

  The answer is 480 for every reason. §21.4.18 covers a callee "in a state that
  precludes communication", which is what a screened number is and also what a
  switched-off phone says, so one answer gives a scanner no way to tell a
  guarded extension from an unattended one. 404 was rejected as an enumeration
  oracle, 503 because §21.5.4 has a proxy stop forwarding to this agent
  altogether, and 6xx because it speaks for the person rather than the device
  and would silence the desk phone they are also registered on.

- **The `sipral` crate is the facade it was always described as.** It was eleven
  lines — a name held on crates.io — while `docs/01-architecture.md` said it was
  where signalling and media meet. Nothing joined them, so `MediaPlan` and
  `MediaCapabilities` were a vocabulary nobody spoke, and an application that
  wanted a call with audio in it wrote the join itself.

  It now carries: a codec catalogue that says what this build actually contains,
  in the order it offers them, and what one live call settled on — a name the
  build has no encoder for is refused where the order is set rather than dropped
  where it would have been used; a media session that owns one call's audio,
  taking the negotiated description, driving the codec and the jitter buffer and
  comfort noise, allocating nothing per packet and reading no clock; the engine
  that attaches a session when a call confirms, follows it through hold, resume,
  a peer that moved and a codec change, and releases it with the call's
  statistics; call recording, both directions mixed into one WAVE file the crate
  never opens itself; stream statistics that travel, live and at the end; and a
  watchdog that says when inbound audio stops and when it comes back, silent
  while this end is not meant to be receiving, because an alarm that cries wolf
  during hold is an alarm an application learns to ignore.

  The rule it exists to keep is unchanged: `sipral-ua` still reaches into no
  media crate and no media crate reaches into it. The join lives here because
  here is the only place the architecture allows it.

  Deliberately not yet: ICE, SRTP keying and DTMF sending, each with its seam
  named in the code rather than left to be found. And the C ABI still points at
  signalling alone, which is the next thing to close.

- One declaration for the ABI's event numbers, and disagreeing with it is a
  build failure. The kinds, their names and their numbers are generated from a
  single list, with an assertion that the list runs `1, 2, 3, …` with nothing
  repeated, moved or missing. The hole it closes is the one the requirements
  describe from the other side: two features written in two branches each take
  the number after the last kind, both compile, and the one that lands second
  has silently renumbered an event a shipped binding already knows. The numbers
  of the six features already committed to are spent now, as reserved lines
  naming what each belongs to, so taking one means reading a number rather than
  choosing it.

- The shapes of bad network a call is measured over, as fixtures in
  `interop/impairment/` rather than as arguments somebody types. A threshold
  measured against a profile that lives in a shell history is a threshold
  nobody can reproduce. Four of them: bursty loss with jitter and reordering; a
  mobile leg losing two per cent in bursts on a link whose delay moves; a
  geostationary carrier, where the interesting failure is arithmetic rather
  than audio, because a retransmission schedule tuned on a fast path gives up
  before a satellite answers; and a link that disappears for eight seconds in
  the middle of the call.
  That last one is the one worth having, and the one an easy simulator does not
  produce: loss and delay held constant for a whole call are a bad line, not an
  interruption. It does not ask whether audio survived, since eight seconds of
  nothing cannot be concealed, but whether the stack is still there afterwards
  — the dialog kept, no timer having fired into the gap, and a buffer that
  returns to the target it had rather than staying where the gap left it. Each
  profile declares what must appear in the qdisc once it is applied, and the
  runner reads it back, because `tc` accepts settings the kernel then discards
  in silence and a run whose impairment never happened is byte for byte a clean
  one.

### Fixed

- A challenge to any request inside a call is now answered, not given up on.
  Only REGISTER and the INVITE that opened a call were retried with
  credentials; a 401 or 407 on a BYE, CANCEL, PRACK, REFER, re-INVITE or
  UPDATE fell through to the application as an unclaimed event, and §22.2 does
  not stop at the first request of a dialog. The one with teeth is the BYE: a
  carrier that challenges it is told nothing more, and keeps a call open that
  this end has hung up. Three things had to be settled underneath. A BYE ends
  its dialog as it goes, so by the time the challenge arrives there is no
  dialog to take a `CSeq` from — it now comes from the request that was
  refused, which is right precisely because nothing will ever ask that dialog
  for another number. The account behind a request is kept beside the call
  rather than inside it, since a BYE outlives the call it ended. And a REFER
  that is refused now gives back the seat it took, without which the first
  refusal was the last transfer that call could ever attempt.

### Added

- `scripts/lab.sh` and `scripts/fuzz.sh`, and no CI configuration at all.
  Nothing runs on hardware that is not ours: a runner that builds, signs or
  publishes needs credentials on somebody else's machine, and for Apple
  signing there is no way to give it one — a runner has no keychain. So the
  three jobs that were hosted are three scripts. `scripts/check.sh` was already
  the gate and is unchanged; `lab.sh` brings the three-container lab up, runs
  the flows against each server and repeats one over a link made bad with
  `tc netem`; `fuzz.sh` runs every target for as long as it is given.
  `.github/workflows/` is gone and gitignored.
- G.722 wired into the interop harness, and the trap that goes with it closed.
  What used to be a single `Law` field is a codec, because G.711's samples,
  octets and timestamp ticks for a twenty-millisecond frame are all 160 and
  G.722's are 320, 160 and 160 — one constant served all three, and anything
  written against that shape encodes half a frame and calls it a packet. The
  session now accepts payload type 9, the tone keeps its pitch when the rate
  doubles, and `SIPRAL_CODEC=g722` puts the wideband codec first in the offer
  so the same ten flows run against real software with it. Not the default:
  every lab server takes G.722, so offering it unasked would quietly change
  what those flows have been proving.
- G.722 in `sipral-media`, written from ITU-T Recommendation G.722 (09/2012).
  The twenty-four-tap filter pair that splits sixteen kilohertz into two bands
  of eight and puts them back together, six-bit ADPCM on the lower band and
  two-bit on the higher, the logarithmic scale factor and its adaptation, the
  sixth-order zero section and second-order pole section, and all three
  decoder modes. Every arithmetic operation is §6.2's, including its
  definition of multiplication as a shift and its saturating addition, because
  a wrapping add here decodes to noise only on loud passages.
  The roadmap used to say this would be linked. There is nothing to link: the
  usual library is spandsp's, which the clean-room rule forbids by name, and
  the Rust crate that looks free of it carries spandsp's comments word for
  word. A Recommendation is a specification, and this is implemented from it.
  Every table was read off the document twice, independently, and compared;
  the one cell the two readings disagreed on was settled against the closed
  form the table follows. Two of the document's own slips are handled and
  written down: Table 19 prints six characters for a five-bit codeword, and
  Table 14 prints two of its columns two rows lower than the address they are
  addressed by.
  G.722's RTP clock rate is 8000 although it samples at 16000 (RFC 3551
  §4.5.2), so `SAMPLE_RATE` and `CLOCK_RATE` are separate constants and
  `frame_samples`, `frame_octets` and `frame_ticks` are three different
  numbers for the same frame.
- SRTP and SRTCP in `sipral-rtp`, written from RFC 3711. Counter mode and f8
  keystreams, HMAC-SHA-1 tags, the key derivation of §4.3 with erratum 3712
  applied to the SRTCP index, the implicit packet index of §3.3.1 with
  Appendix A's estimator, and a replay window twice the size §3.3.2 requires.
  The three suites RFC 4568 defines, the `UNENCRYPTED_*` and
  `UNAUTHENTICATED_SRTP` session parameters, an optional master key
  identifier, and the packet counts §9.2 caps at 2^48 and 2^31.
  Protecting and unprotecting happen in the caller's own buffer, so a
  protected packet costs no allocation. Every test vector in the RFC's
  Appendix B is in the suite, as are RFC 3174's for SHA-1 and RFC 2202's for
  HMAC.
  The block cipher comes from the `aes` crate, the first thing `sipral-rtp`
  depends on, because a table-driven AES leaks its key through the cache;
  everything above it is in-tree. Linking libsrtp2, which the roadmap used to
  name, was dropped: it is C, and this crate denies `unsafe`.
- `RtpSession::protected`, which puts SRTP under an ordinary RTP stream. What
  it builds goes out protected and what arrives is verified before any of it
  is believed, so the order RFC 3711 §3.3 sets out is not something an
  integrator can get wrong. `RtpSession::receive` and `rtcp_receive` now take
  the caller's buffer mutably, because a receiver decrypts in place.
- The `a=crypto` line read as values in `sipral-core`: the suite, the master
  key and salt out of the `inline:` parameter, the lifetime in both forms, the
  master key identifier, and the session parameters that say whether to
  encrypt and whether to authenticate. Every rule RFC 4568 states as making
  the attribute invalid refuses it. A peer that sends back a key we offered is
  refused too — §7.1.2 requires the keys to differ, and one key protecting
  both directions is the failure the transform cannot survive.
- Hold and resume in `sipral-ua`, and the offers that come after them. Hold is
  RFC 3264 §8.4's: the description already negotiated, with a stream that was
  `sendrecv` marked `sendonly` and one that was `recvonly` marked `inactive`,
  and the `o=` version moved on. The stack writes it, so the application says
  hold rather than `a=sendonly`, and resume puts back the direction each stream
  started with rather than assuming `sendrecv`. `Hold` has a flag per
  direction, because §8.4 holds each one separately; the far end holding us is
  read off `sendonly`, `inactive`, or the `0.0.0.0` address RFC 2543 used, and
  reported as `SessionChanged`.
  Which request carries the change is the dialog's decision first: a confirmed
  call uses a re-INVITE, which RFC 3311 §5.1 recommends outright, and an early
  one uses UPDATE, because §14.1 forbids a second INVITE while the first is
  running — and only when the far end listed UPDATE in an `Allow` (§4), which
  this end now advertises on its INVITE, on a provisional carrying a
  description, and on the 2xx.
  An offer arriving from the far end is answered here when it keeps the streams
  and the formats that were negotiated, because the answer is then this end's
  own ports with the direction §6.1 leaves. One that changes the codecs or the
  stream list arrives as `Reoffer` with the transaction still open, for
  `accept_reoffer` or `reject_reoffer`; a body that claims to be a session
  description and is not gets a 488 with the `Warning` §14.2 asks for.
  Glare is handled from both sides: a 491 carries the wait §14.1 draws and the
  change goes out again once, and an offer that crosses one of ours is answered
  491 while one that arrives on top of an unanswered offer of theirs is
  answered 500 with a drawn `Retry-After` (RFC 3311 §5.2, generalised to both
  requests).
- `StatusCode::NOT_ACCEPTABLE_HERE`, the refusal that is about the session
  description rather than about the request that carried it.
- A 2xx that is never acknowledged now ends the dialog with a BYE, which
  §13.3.1.4 asks for and §14.2 repeats for a re-INVITE. RFC 6026's timer L was
  ending the transaction in silence, so the layer above could not tell an ACK
  that arrived from one that never did; it now reports
  `TerminationReason::TimedOut`, and `sipral-ua` sends the BYE and reports the
  call as unreachable. Without it a far end that stops answering leaves a line
  busy for as long as the process runs.
- `OutgoingResponse::status`, to read back what a response was built with.
- Session timers (RFC 4028) in `sipral-ua`. `Supported: timer` on every request,
  an interval asked for per account and thirty minutes by default, the
  refresher left to the negotiation on the first INVITE and carried afterwards.
  The refresher refreshes at half the interval (§7.2) and the other end hangs up
  shortly before expiry (§10), reporting `CallEndReason::Expired`. The refresh
  is an UPDATE where the peer takes one and a re-INVITE where it does not,
  repeating the description already agreed unchanged, which is how §7.4 and
  RFC 3264 §8 together say nothing has moved. A 422 sends the INVITE again on
  the same `Call-ID` with the demanded floor, once; an incoming interval below
  §5's ninety seconds is answered 422 before the application sees it.
- `StatusCode::SESSION_INTERVAL_TOO_SMALL`.
- `sipral-rtp`, phase one's share of it: the fixed header read and written
  (RFC 3550 §5.1), the validity checks a receiver makes before it believes a
  source (Appendix A.1) including the probation state machine and sequence
  wraparound, the marker-bit rule the audio profile adds (RFC 3551 §4.1),
  symmetric RTP with latching onto the first valid packet's source, and a
  fixed-depth de-jitter buffer that takes reordering as normal, drops
  duplicates by sequence number and never grows past its depth. Sans-I/O, with
  no dependency on `sipral-core`. RTCP, the adaptive buffer, loss concealment,
  DTMF and SRTP are later phases and are not stubbed here.
- `sipral-media`, phase one's share: G.711 mu-law and A-law, encode and decode,
  written from the companding law, with the frame arithmetic a caller needs and
  the two payload types RFC 3551 fixes. Every one of the 512 code points is
  round-tripped in the tests, which is the strongest property the code has.
- The interop lab under `interop/`: Kamailio, FreeSWITCH and Asterisk on
  default settings in Compose, a capture beside them, and a harness that drives
  `sipral-ua` through register, call, and hold and resume, judging each flow
  against conditions written before the run. It runs as its own CI job on
  Linux. Every other test in this workspace runs the stack against a peer we
  wrote; this is the first that does not.
- Reliable provisional responses on the answering side (RFC 3262). `ring` sends
  reliably exactly when the INVITE asked — §3 leaves no choice either way — and
  the PRACK is answered 2xx here, with an answer to any offer it carried. A
  reliable response that carried a description holds the 2xx to the INVITE until
  it is acknowledged (§5), so an application that answers early has its 200 kept
  and sent on the PRACK rather than putting two unanswered offers on the wire.
  In the other direction an offer arriving in a reliable provisional is reported
  by `answer_wanted` on `CallProgress` and answered with
  `UserAgent::answer_early`, which puts it in the PRACK where §5 wants it.
- A `Require` naming an extension that is not implemented is answered 420 with
  the token in `Unsupported` (§8.2.2.3), before the application sees the call.
- Transfer, both kinds (RFC 3515, RFC 3891). `transfer` sends a REFER and
  reports what the transferee says in its `message/sipfrag` NOTIFYs as
  `TransferProgress` and `TransferDone`; the call is given up only when the
  transfer has actually succeeded, because hanging up when the REFER goes turns
  a failure into a call that vanished. `transfer_to` sends the other call's
  remote target with an escaped `Replaces` naming its dialog, which is the only
  difference between an attended transfer and a blind one.
  A REFER that arrives is `TransferRequested`, taken with `accept_transfer` —
  202, the opening NOTIFY, and the call it asked for — or refused with
  `reject_transfer`; anything but exactly one `Refer-To` is answered 400.
  `Replaces` on an incoming INVITE is matched before the application sees it,
  with §3's status code for each way it can fail: 481 for no match or several,
  603 for a dialog that has ended, 486 for `early-only` against a confirmed
  one. A match is replaced when the new call is answered, and reported as
  `CallReplaced`.
- The reference loop, behind the `reference-loop` feature and off by default.
  `Runtime::bind` gives a `UserAgent` with a datagram socket under it, a thread
  per socket doing the blocking reads, and a `Handler` with two methods. It
  answers `ResolveNeeded` with an A lookup and `TransportWanted` by opening the
  TCP connection §18.1.1 asks for; it does not do SRV, does not link TLS, and
  binds to a named address rather than a wildcard, because `std::net` cannot
  say which local address a datagram arrived on and RFC 3581 §4 needs that.
  With it comes the first test in this workspace where two stacks talk to each
  other over real sockets rather than to a peer written in the same file: an
  INVITE, a 180, a 200, the ACK, a hold and a BYE, on loopback.

### Fixed

- The reference loop could end without writing what it had been given. A
  handler that hangs up and stops in the same breath is the ordinary shape of
  an application, and the BYE was still in the queue when the loop came out —
  so the far end kept the call. Found by the loopback test on its first run,
  which is what that test is for.
- A re-INVITE with no session description could start a second offer/answer
  exchange on top of an unfinished one. §14.1 has such a request ask *this* end
  to offer, so it is the same exchange starting over, and it now meets the same
  491 or 500 that one carrying an offer does.
- A request the far end was still waiting on was abandoned when the call ended.
  §15.1.2: "The UAS MUST still respond to any pending requests received for
  that dialog. It is RECOMMENDED that a 487 (Request Terminated) response be
  generated to those pending requests." Left alone it was retransmitted at the
  far end until it gave up.
- An offer written by the application is given an `o=` version that has moved.
  RFC 3264 §8 makes an unchanged version a promise that the bytes are
  unchanged, and that is not a promise to leave a caller free to break.

- Calls in `sipral-ua`: place, answer, refuse, hang up, and forks handled
  rather than hidden. A `CallHandle` names one dialog, so an INVITE a proxy
  forked to three phones becomes three calls under one attempt, each reported
  as it appears; `ForkPolicy` says what happens to the ones that are not kept,
  and every 2xx among them is acknowledged either way, because §13.2.2.4 does
  not make that conditional. The ACK is sent by the stack rather than offered
  to the application — the exception being a call placed without an offer,
  where the answer travels in the ACK and only the application has one.
  Hanging up is one call that means a CANCEL, a BYE or a refusal depending on
  where the call is. An incoming INVITE is matched to the account it was
  addressed to, and one that matches none is still reported.
- `sipral-ua`, the first crate above the core, and registration in it. An
  account is a registrar, an identity and a password; `UserAgent` keeps its
  binding alive without being asked again. It has the endpoint's five calls,
  so the same event loop drives either and a year of refreshes is a test that
  finishes in a millisecond.
  The policy the core refuses to have lives here: the refresh at 0.85 of what
  the registrar granted and never later than thirty seconds before it lapses;
  the granted expiry winning over the requested one, read off the `Contact`
  the registrar echoed back by §19.1.4 equivalence; one `Call-ID` per boot
  cycle (§10.2.4); a challenge answered from the account, and the same
  challenge coming back a second time stopping rather than locking the
  account; a 423 obeyed once (§10.2.8); and RFC 5626 §4.5's back-off, with the
  wait drawn between half the bound and the bound so that a thousand phones
  that lost one server do not come back in the same second. What cannot be
  fixed by trying again — a 403, a refused password, a redirect — stops and
  says so, with the response whole.
- `Endpoint::token`, so the layer above draws its `Call-ID`s and its intervals
  from the stream the branches come from rather than asking the caller for a
  second seed.

### Fixed

- A refused re-INVITE held its dialog shut. §14.1 lets a new INVITE go once the
  old transaction is "completed or terminated", and a refusal completes it at
  once — the ACK for a non-2xx belongs to the transaction, not to the dialog —
  but the endpoint waited for an ACK it would never build, so nothing could be
  offered again for the thirty-two seconds of timer D. §14.1 asks for a change
  refused with 491 to be offered again after two to four.
- A response to a non-INVITE request `sipral-ua` did not send was dropped
  instead of being passed through. Anything the application starts through
  `UserAgent::endpoint` is its own news, and `UaEvent::Unclaimed` promises that
  nothing is lost on the way through.
- A re-INVITE could not finish. Its responses were offered to the dialog set
  that follows a forked INVITE, which a re-INVITE has none of, so every answer
  to one — 200, 488, 491 — was dropped in silence and the call could never be
  put on hold. RFC 3261 §14.1 is explicit that a re-INVITE never forks, so it
  now has a path of its own: the response feeds the dialog it was sent in, the
  remote target is refreshed from the 2xx (§12.2.1.2), and the ACK is built
  from the re-INVITE so that it carries the right `CSeq`. `Endpoint::reinvite`
  takes an `OutgoingInDialogRequest` and requires the `Contact` §8.1.1.8 makes
  mandatory; the 2xx is acknowledged with the new `Endpoint::ack_reinvite`,
  which keeps the ACK and answers retransmissions with it.
- `Event::Failed` carries the response. A status code alone cannot say what a
  3xx names or what a `Retry-After` asked for, and the bytes were being thrown
  away for every non-2xx final.
- `Event::ResolveNeeded` named the wrong host for a URI with a `maddr`.
  RFC 3263 §4 makes the target the `maddr` when there is one — the response
  path already did this, so the two halves of one rule disagreed.

### Added

- Glare, both ways (§14.2, RFC 3311 §5.2). An INVITE that crosses one of ours
  inside a dialog is answered 491, a second one that arrives before we answered
  the first is answered 500 with a drawn `Retry-After`, and so is a second
  UPDATE; none of them reaches the caller, because none is a decision. The end
  that receives a 491 gets `Event::ReinviteGlare` with how long to wait, drawn
  from the range §14.1 gives it — which differs by who generated the `Call-ID`,
  so that two ends backing off do not collide again.
- `SendError::InviteInProgress` and `SendError::WrongMethod`: §14.1 forbids a
  second INVITE transaction in a dialog while one is running in either
  direction, and an INVITE handed to `request_in_dialog` would have run on a
  transaction machine that cannot acknowledge it.

### Changed

- Documents corrected against the tree after an outside reading of the README.
  RFC 3263 is split in the index between what the core owns and what the caller
  does, with RFC 2782 named next to it; RFC 3327 and RFC 8599 added; iLBC and
  AMR given their exclusion rows. `a=ice-lite` is now conditioned on a public
  address, which RFC 8445 Appendix A requires and which separates the headless
  build from the softphone. SDES is stated to need a secured signalling channel
  (RFC 4568 §7). The layer diagram says outright that signalling and media do
  not depend on each other, and `MediaPlan` and `MediaCapabilities` name what
  crosses between them. The README names the codecs, the fuzzing and the parser
  bounds, and no longer refers to a transport crate that does not exist.
- The project's home is `sipral.org`. `Cargo.toml`, both package READMEs and the
  NuGet `PackageProjectUrl` say so; the published NuGet 0.0.1 still carries the
  previous domain and is corrected at the next version.

### Added

- The mark, and the rules for drawing it. `assets/` carries the mark and the
  horizontal lockup as SVG and PNG, light and dark, with `assets/BRAND.md` for
  the geometry, the three colours and the one red cell. The README shows the
  lockup, every crate carries `html_logo_url` and `html_favicon_url` for
  docs.rs, and the NuGet package carries an icon. The lockup SVG keeps the
  wordmark as live text, so anywhere Archivo is not installed the PNG is the
  one to use — which `BRAND.md` says.
- `scripts/check.sh` fails on embedded provenance metadata. Artwork arrives with
  a signed C2PA manifest naming the tool that made it, in a PNG `caBX` chunk or
  an SVG `<metadata>` element; it is base64 inside a binary, so the existing
  text scan never saw it, and this repository is public. The files in `assets/`
  were stripped before being committed — PNG down to `IHDR`, `PLTE`, `tRNS`,
  `IDAT`, `IEND` and `sRGB`, SVG without `<metadata>` — which changes no pixel.

### Changed

- Phase 1 readiness review, nine gaps closed: WebSocket scoped to phase 2 and
  its framing corrected (one SIP message per WebSocket message, never the
  `Content-Length` framer); keepalive given a home in `EndpointConfig`; the
  `sipral-ua` call handle renamed away from the core's `CallId`; a fuzzing
  plan and a per-flow interoperability pass bar in `docs/11-testing.md`; the
  `sipral` facade crate inheriting version, licence and lints from the
  workspace; `scripts/check.sh` failing on version drift between the
  workspace and the .NET package.
- Design and licensing documents checked claim by claim against the RFC text
  and the primary sources; 20 corrections applied. The ones that change
  behaviour: the release profile no longer sets `panic = "abort"`, because the
  FFI layer has to catch unwinding at the C boundary; `sipral-ffi` and
  `sipral-io-coreaudio` now carry the `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic`/indexing lints
  they were silently missing; phase 1 explicitly includes the minimal RTP and
  G.711 slice a bidirectional call needs; `LICENSING.md` no longer implies that
  charging for a product is by itself what triggers the commercial arm. CI
  installs the toolchain from `rust-toolchain.toml` instead of pinning a second
  time in the workflow, and runs the gitleaks binary (pinned, checksum
  verified) instead of the marketplace action, which requires a paid licence
  on organisation repositories.

### Added

- Workspace skeleton: the eight crates from `docs/01-architecture.md`, each with
  its scope documented and nothing implemented.
- Design documents for phase 0: architecture, clean-room rules, signalling
  core, user agent, media, NAT, headless endpoint, FFI, RFC index, roadmap,
  testing.
- Licensing set: AGPL-3.0-only alongside a commercial arm, with `LICENSING.md`,
  `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md`, `TRADEMARK.md`, `AUTHORS`, `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`,
  and SPDX headers on every source file.
- `deny.toml` with a permissive-only allow-list, enforced by the check script.
- `scripts/check.sh`: licence headers, provenance, published-tree language,
  internal files and captures, build, lints, tests, dependency licences,
  secrets.
- CI on Linux, macOS and Windows, plus separate licence and hygiene jobs.
- `sipral-core::msg`: the message layer's foundation. `Span`, `HeaderSlot` and
  a reusable `ParseScratch`; `Method` and `StatusCode`; `RawMessage` as a view
  over the caller's buffer; and a parser that locates the start line, the
  header fields and the body without copying any of them. Folded values are one
  slot with their interior CRLF intact, repeated headers are one slot each in
  wire order, and `Content-Length` frames the body so trailing octets in a
  datagram are ignored. Bounded by a `Limits` struct so a hostile peer cannot
  make it do unbounded work, and written so that no input reaches a panic.
  37 tests, several of them RFC 4475 cases the corpus will assert in full later.
- `sipral-core::msg::HeaderName`: the 38 header fields the stack knows, matched
  whatever their case and in either form. Fifteen compact forms, each read out
  of the RFC that defines it rather than from memory. `RawMessage` gains
  `header`, `header_values`, `header_count` and `header_names`, so asking for
  `Via` finds a `v:` line and asking for an extension is case-insensitive too.
- `sipral-core::msg::UriRef`: SIP URIs in parts, borrowed from the buffer.
  An enum rather than a struct, because only `sip:` and `sips:` have a
  hostport: a `tel:` URI and an unknown scheme are kept whole instead of being
  forced into a shape they do not have. The userinfo boundary is settled before
  parameters or headers are looked for, since `user` may contain `;` and `?`
  unescaped. Parameters and headers are walked on demand, and `unescape`
  handles `%` escapes including `%00`, leaving a stray `%` alone because the
  corpus has one in a message that is valid.
- `sipral-core::msg::lex`: the lexical rules every header value obeys, in one
  place instead of once per field. Unfolding, comma-separated values, and
  `;name=value` parameters, all of which stop at a quoted string or a `<...>`
  URI. `Contact: "Smith, John" <sip:j@x>` is one value; `qop="auth=1,auth-int"`
  is one parameter.
- `sipral-core::msg::OwnedMessage`: the same bytes and header index behind two
  `Arc`s, so a message the stack keeps costs one copy and a clone costs none.
  Bytes past the body are left behind, so a second request sharing a datagram
  is not carried along.
- `sipral-core::msg::scalar`: the fields that carry a number, and `CSeq`, which
  carries one and a method. The separator inside `CSeq` and `RAck` is `LWS`, so
  a fold between the digits and the method still reads. Overflow is two rules,
  not one: a `CSeq` that does not fit in 32 bits is refused, while an `Expires`
  parses and reports that it did not fit, because the RFC lets an element fall
  back to its default there. Nothing is truncated, so a hundred-digit `Expires`
  cannot become a plausible small number.
- `sipral-core::msg::ViaRef`: the field that decides where a response goes.
  `SLASH` and `COLON` absorb surrounding whitespace, so the two slashes are
  located before anything else; `received` carries an IPv6 address without
  brackets, unlike everywhere else, and accepts them anyway because they are
  sent; `ttl` is `1*3DIGIT`, so `;ttl=1234` is not a ttl at all; `rport` has
  three states and `;rport=` is none of them. A `Via` with no branch is an RFC
  2543 peer to be matched per §17.2.3, not a malformed header.
- `sipral-core::msg::NameAddrRef`: `From`, `To` and `Contact`. The angle
  brackets decide who owns the parameters — inside them `;transport=tcp` is on
  the URI, outside them it is on the header field — and RFC 4475 `cparam01` and
  `cparam02` are one address written both ways to catch a stack that cannot
  tell. Whitespace lives outside the brackets, so `< sip:a@b >` is refused; a
  display name is a token run or a quoted string and nothing else, so
  `Bell, Alexander <sip:...>` is refused while `caller<sip:...>` is accepted as
  the documented grammar defect it is; an unterminated quoted string is refused
  rather than guessed at. `Contact: *` is the whole field or nothing.
  `RawMessage` gains `from`, `to`, `contact` and `field_values`, the last
  walking a comma-separated field across its lines and its commas alike.
- `sipral-core::msg::RouteRef`: `Route` and `Record-Route`. A route entry is a
  `name-addr` with no bracket-less alternative, so `Route: sip:p1;lr` is
  refused rather than guessed at — without the `>` there is nothing to say
  where the URI ends. `is_loose_route()` reads `;lr` on the URI and not on the
  header field, because `<sip:p1>;lr` is a strict router carrying a parameter
  that happens to be spelled the same, and getting that backwards sends the
  request to a strict router with a Request-URI it cannot use. Entries come
  back in wire order, never sorted or deduplicated.
- `sipral-core::msg::ChallengeRef` and `CredentialsRef`: digest challenges and
  credentials, as two types rather than one, because `qop` is a quoted comma
  list in a challenge and a bare token in credentials and the RFC's own worked
  example writes both. `realm`, `nonce`, `cnonce`, `username` and `opaque` come
  back unescaped; `uri` and `response` come back exactly as written, since
  neither is a `quoted-string` and a Request-URI is no place to resolve
  backslashes. `response` has no fixed length, per RFC 8760. Each header line
  is one value: RFC 3261 §20.7 and §20.28 exempt these fields from
  comma-joining, and several challenges are several lines in preference order.
- `sipral-core::msg::TokenIter` and `MediaTypeRef`: `Require`, `Proxy-Require`,
  `Supported`, `Unsupported`, `Content-Encoding`, `Accept`, `Allow` and
  `Content-Type`. Option tags are matched without case; methods are not,
  because the six RFC 3261 verbs are fixed-case literals in the grammar and
  `Allow: invite` is an extension method that happens to be spelled like one
  of them.
- `sipral-core::msg::RequestBuilder` and `ResponseBuilder`: writing a message
  out. Deterministic — same inputs, same bytes, whatever order the setters were
  called in — because a retransmission has to be the identical datagram and a
  byte-comparing test is worth nothing otherwise. `Via` goes first, then the
  routing and dialog fields, then whatever else the caller added, then the
  body's two fields; `Content-Length` is always written, since a stream
  transport has no other way to find the end of a message. A response copies
  what RFC 3261 §8.2.6.2 says must be equal, adds a `To` tag only when the
  request carried none, and copies `Record-Route` only when asked, because
  §12.1.1 requires that of a response establishing a dialog and only the
  caller knows whether this is one. No value may hold CR or LF: a header value
  goes out on one line, and a caller's data with a line break in it would
  otherwise write headers of its own.
- `sipral-core::msg::StreamFramer`: reassembling TCP and TLS into messages, and
  the one place in the receive path that copies. A message without
  `Content-Length` is refused rather than read to the end of the buffer, since
  RFC 3261 §18.3 makes the field mandatory on a stream and guessing would
  swallow whatever followed. Keep-alives (RFC 5626 §4.4.1) are skipped between
  messages and counted, so the connection's owner can send the single CRLF a
  double CRLF is owed. Work is bounded per byte received rather than per call:
  a peer feeding one byte at a time cannot make reassembly quadratic.
- `RawMessage::validate`: the question a UAS asks before answering — is this a
  message the stack can act on, or one that draws a 400? A message can be
  framed correctly and still carry a `From` whose display name is not one, a
  `CSeq` naming a different method than the start line, or a `Date` in a zone
  nobody can read. The parser has no business refusing those, since it does not
  know which fields the caller will read, so the question is asked once, here,
  by whoever is about to answer.
- `SipDate` and `RawMessage::date`: RFC 3261 §20.17, which narrows RFC 1123 to
  GMT and says outright that the names are case-sensitive. `EST` is not a zone
  this reads, and neither is `UT`, `UTC` or `gmt`.
- `sipral-core::transaction`: the handles the transaction layer is addressed
  by. Typed by machine, so answering a PRACK with an INVITE server transaction
  handle is a compile error rather than a runtime one, and the guarantee
  survives into C as one struct per kind. Generational, so a handle issued
  before a transaction died never answers to whoever took its slot — which is
  what a late retransmission is holding. The four state enums carry RFC 6026's
  `Accepted` on both INVITE machines.
- The INVITE client transaction (RFC 3261 §17.1.1, RFC 6026 §7.2), and the ACK
  a client transaction builds for a final response that is not a 2xx. A 2xx
  does not end the transaction: the machine moves to `Accepted` and stays there
  for timer M, so a retransmitted 2xx or one from another fork is passed up
  rather than dropped as a stray. A provisional response stops both timer A and
  timer B, because how long to wait for a ringing phone is the user's decision.
  A retransmitted final response re-sends the ACK and is not reported twice.
  On UDP the request goes out seven times in 64·T1, which is what the RFC says
  that number is for.
- The non-INVITE client transaction (RFC 3261 §17.1.2), which is what REGISTER,
  OPTIONS, BYE and MESSAGE run on. Retransmissions cap at T2 rather than
  doubling forever, and a provisional response does not stop them — it moves
  the machine to `Proceeding`, where the interval is T2 flat and timer F still
  ends the transaction. Only an INVITE gets to ring indefinitely.
- The two server transactions (RFC 3261 §17.2, RFC 6026 §8.1). The INVITE one
  sends a 100 Trying at once — the transaction layer never knows whether the
  user will answer within 200 ms, and a redundant 100 costs one datagram while
  a missing one costs six retransmitted INVITEs. A 2xx puts it in `Accepted`,
  where retransmitted INVITEs are absorbed rather than answered again and an
  arriving ACK is passed up rather than swallowed, because after a 2xx the ACK
  belongs to the dialog. A non-2xx final response is retransmitted by timer G,
  but only on an unreliable transport. The non-INVITE one sends nothing until
  the user says so: in `Trying` a retransmitted request is discarded, since
  inventing a response the user never wrote is worse than silence.
- Message matching (RFC 3261 §17.1.3 and §17.2.3). A response finds its client
  transaction by branch and `CSeq` method — the method matters because a CANCEL
  borrows the branch of the request it cancels while being a transaction of its
  own. A request finds its server transaction by branch, the `Via`'s sent-by
  and the method, with an ACK keyed as the INVITE it answers. A peer without
  the magic cookie is matched the pre-3261 way instead, on the Request-URI,
  From tag, `Call-ID`, `CSeq` number and top `Via`.
- CANCEL (RFC 3261 §9.1): built to look exactly like the INVITE it cancels so
  the two can be paired, with `Route` copied for stateless proxies and
  `Require`/`Proxy-Require` deliberately dropped. Asking to cancel is always
  accepted while the transaction is open: a CANCEL may not be sent before a
  provisional response has arrived — the server could otherwise receive it
  before the INVITE and have nothing to cancel — so one asked for too early is
  held and released at the first provisional rather than refused.
- Dialogs (RFC 3261 §12): route set, remote target, the two sequence spaces,
  the `secure` flag and both ways of opening one — from the response to a
  request we sent, and from a request we are answering. The route set is
  reversed for the caller and kept in order for the callee, because the two
  ends face opposite ways down the same path, and it is built from the bytes as
  they arrived so that every URI parameter survives. Requests come out through
  §12.2.1.1, including the strict-router rewrite for proxies that predate loose
  routing: the request is addressed to the first hop and the real target is
  pushed to the end of the `Route`, where a loose router lifts it back. ACK and
  CANCEL are refused there — their number belongs to the request they answer.
  The remote target moves only for a re-INVITE or an UPDATE (RFC 3311 §5.1),
  never for an ACK; a request whose `CSeq` runs backwards is answered 500 and
  changes nothing.
- Digest authentication (RFC 3261 §22, RFC 8760): MD5, MD5-sess, SHA-256,
  SHA-256-sess, SHA-512-256 and SHA-512-256-sess, with `qop=auth` and the
  counter that makes a captured response useless a second time. The three hash
  functions are written out here, because the crate has no dependencies, and
  each is checked against published digests — including the SHA-256 of the
  empty string that RFC 8760 §2.6 prints — before anything is built on it.
  `AuthCache` keeps a challenge per protection domain so a later request can
  carry credentials without a round trip, answers the topmost challenge it
  understands per realm, keeps the 401 and 407 spaces apart, and refuses to
  answer the same nonce twice after a refusal: §22.1 forbids re-attempting
  credentials that were just rejected, and repeating them only locks the
  account. A `-sess` algorithm without `qop` is treated as unanswerable rather
  than guessed at, which is what §22.4 rule 8 leaves. The password lives in a
  `Secret` with no `Debug` and no way out of its module, overwritten on drop as
  far as safe Rust can promise.
- SDP (RFC 4566) and offer/answer (RFC 3264). A description that is read and
  written back comes out as it went in, down to the lines the stack has no use
  for — an SDP body travels through a call inside messages that get forwarded,
  so quietly dropping what is not understood breaks the next extension somebody
  adds. Ordering is enforced the way §5 fixes it, and a type letter that is not
  one of the fourteen refuses the whole description rather than the line, which
  is what §5 asks for. `answer()` builds the answer from the offer: the same
  number of streams in the same order, the same `t=` line, the payload mappings
  the offer defined, and a direction narrowed to what the offer allows — an
  offer of `sendonly` can only be answered `recvonly` or `inactive`. Which
  codecs to keep and which streams to take arrive as arguments; there is no
  policy here. The RFC 3264 §10.1 exchange is a test, byte for byte, and a
  fourth fuzz target asserts that writing a description out and reading it back
  yields the same description.
- Forking and the ACK for a 2xx (RFC 3261 §13.2.2). One INVITE can produce
  several dialogs — a proxy rings the desk phone, the mobile and the voicemail,
  and each branch that answers is told apart by its `To` tag. `DialogSet` keeps
  them all and chooses between none of them: which fork to keep is policy, and
  policy does not live in the core. A non-2xx final ends every dialog still
  early and leaves an already confirmed one alone; a 2xx arriving after that is
  still taken, because dropping it would leave a call standing at the far end
  with nobody able to hang it up. The 2xx confirming an early dialog recomputes
  its route set, which RFC 2543 compatibility requires and which nothing else
  in a dialog's life does. The ACK for a 2xx belongs to the dialog rather than
  the transaction: the caller builds it once, since only the caller knows
  whether there is an answer to put in it, and every retransmitted 2xx after
  that is answered from the stored bytes.
- `sipral-core::endpoint`: what a transport is to a stack that never opens one.
  `TransportProtocol` derives from the protocol alone everything the RFCs make
  conditional on the transport — reliability, which is what RFC 3261 §17 sets
  timers D, I, J and K to zero on; framing, which is why TCP and TLS need
  `Content-Length` and WebSocket does not, since RFC 7118 §4.2 puts one SIP
  message in each WebSocket message; and the default ports of §18.1.1.
  `Input` and `Transmit` are the two directions of the whole surface, with the
  payload refcounted because a retransmission has to be the identical datagram.
  `DatagramLimit` is §18.1.1's size rule as two numbers, both settable because
  the RFC's 1300 assumes a 1500-byte Ethernet MTU that plenty of access
  networks do not have.
- `sipral-core::endpoint::Endpoint`: the five calls the whole stack is driven
  through, and the first place the layers are bound together. Bytes and time
  in, bytes and events out; nothing opens a socket, reads a clock or draws a
  random number. The branch, the sent-by, the tags, the `Call-ID` and the
  sequence numbers are the endpoint's, derived from thirty-two bytes of
  caller-supplied entropy, because a caller that writes its own branch writes
  one that repeats. Registrations, calls, forking, CANCEL racing a 200, the
  ACK for a 2xx and its retransmissions, incoming calls and the dialogs they
  open, BYE in both directions, the §18.1.1 switch to a stream transport, the
  §18.2.2 and RFC 3581 rules for where a response goes, the §18.1.2 check that
  discards a response addressed to somebody else, and RFC 5626 keep-alives on
  a jittered interval. Two things happen without asking, because the RFC
  leaves no choice: a CANCEL that matches gets its 200 and its INVITE gets a
  487 (§9.2), and an in-dialog request whose `CSeq` runs backwards gets a 500
  (§12.2.2). Everything else is reported and left to the layer above.
  36 tests, each a scripted exchange on a fake clock.
- Reliable provisional responses (RFC 3262), both ways round. A 180 is a
  datagram like any other and can be lost, which matters because an offer or an
  answer can travel in a 1xx and offer/answer has no recovery from a lost
  message — and because a carrier that puts `100rel` in `Require` will not
  complete a call without one. The end that sends one numbers it, retransmits
  it doubling from T1 with no cap, and refuses to send a second until the first
  is acknowledged; 64·T1 without a PRACK refuses the call with a 500, which is
  what §3 asks for. The end that receives one keeps the highest number it has
  seen in order and silently drops a retransmission or a gap, so a PRACK is
  never sent twice for one response. A PRACK that matches nothing is answered
  481 without being handed up, and one that matches stops the retransmissions
  before the caller sees it. `Supported: 100rel` goes on every outgoing INVITE,
  merged with whatever the caller listed rather than written as a second line
  of the same field. The received numbering is kept per dialog rather than per
  request, because a forked INVITE is answered by several user agents that each
  number from their own transaction; the reasoning is in `docs/03`.
- Answering a challenge (RFC 3261 §22, RFC 8760). A registrar refuses the first
  REGISTER it ever sees and a proxy refuses the first INVITE; that is the
  handshake, not a failure. The endpoint reads the challenge, reports it, and
  waits — the password is the one thing this layer must not hold, and answering
  with the wrong one is how an account gets locked. `retry_with_credentials`
  sends the original request again header for header, body included, with a new
  branch, the next `CSeq` (§22.2, taken from the dialog when it had one so the
  numbering does not collide), and the credentials. The nonce count moves by one
  and never skips, since a skipped number reads to a server as a replay; the
  same nonce coming back without `stale` is a refusal rather than a fresh
  challenge, because §22.1 does not re-try credentials that were just rejected;
  and a challenge nothing here understands is ignored rather than reported, per
  RFC 8760 §2.4. A challenge outlives the transaction that earned it, and the
  set of them is capped so a peer that refuses everything cannot grow it.
- Where a dialog's requests go (RFC 3261 §8.1.2, §12.2.1.1, RFC 3263). A dialog
  keeps the flow its first message travelled on — the address the INVITE went
  to and the answer came back from — which §8.1.2 explicitly allows as "an
  alternate address" and which is the only thing that survives the NAT nearly
  every softphone sits behind. When the next hop the route set or the target
  names is not that address, the endpoint says so rather than resolving it:
  `Event::ResolveNeeded` carries the host, the port if the URI gave one, and
  the transport if the URI or the scheme named one, and `resolved` retargets
  the dialog. Ignoring it is a legitimate choice and the common one. There is
  no `ResolveId`: the only thing the core ever needs resolved is a dialog's next
  hop, so the dialog is both the question and the handle.
- `Uri`, a URI that outlives the buffer it arrived in: the text held once in an
  `Arc<str>` with the parts as offsets into it, so borrowing the parsed form
  back is free and a clone shares the bytes. It carries RFC 3261 §19.1.4
  comparison as `equivalent()` rather than `PartialEq`, because §19.1.4
  equivalence is not transitive and the RFC says so itself. `Tag` and `CallId`
  compare the way the RFC compares them, which is not the same way: byte for
  byte for a `Call-ID` (§20.8), without case for a tag, which is a token
  (§7.3.1).
- `TimerConfig` and the timer schedule: T1, T2 and T4 from RFC 3261 Table 4,
  with every other timer derived from them, and a schedule that answers "when
  do I have to come back" through a shared reference. Nothing reads a clock —
  the caller says what time it is — so a timer diagram from §17 is an ordinary
  test that runs in microseconds. The absorbing timers are zero on a reliable
  transport, because nothing retransmits there.
- Fuzzing under `fuzz/`: three libFuzzer targets over the parser and every
  typed accessor, the stream framer fed at arbitrary read sizes, and the
  builder fed arbitrary bytes as header values to prove a caller's data cannot
  become structure. Outside the workspace with its own lockfile and nightly
  pin, and covered by `cargo deny` too.
- The RFC 4475 corpus is now a test, and it passes: all 49 messages behave as
  `fixtures/rfc4475/manifest.toml` says, and every valid one round trips byte
  for byte. Three messages moved from `semantic` to `reject` — `insuf`,
  `multi01` and `mcl01` sit in the application group but their RFC sections ask
  for a 400 outright — so the split is 13 parse, 22 reject, 14 semantic.
- `StatusCode::reason`: the reason phrases RFC 3261 §21 registers, plus 422
  from RFC 4028, so nobody has to invent one.
- `RawMessage::transaction_lookup_method`: the key §17 matches on. An ACK
  answers INVITE, since the INVITE server transaction absorbs the ACK to a
  non-2xx and an ACK to a 2xx finds nothing under that key and belongs to the
  dialog; a response answers with its `CSeq` method, having none of its own.
- `crates/sipral`: the facade crate, for now a name reservation on crates.io
  that exports a version constant. The only crate with `publish = true`.
- `bindings/dotnet/Sipral`: the .NET package, for now a name reservation
  published to NuGet as `Sipral` 0.0.1.
- `docs/12-core-api.md`: the public surface of `sipral-core` as signatures,
  merged from four independent proposals scored by three reviewers, with
  register, call, CANCEL-race and fork walkthroughs, a fake-clock test, the C
  projection, and a record of what was rejected and why. Adds the RFC 6026
  `Accepted` state to both INVITE machines, which every proposal had missed on
  the client side.
- RFC 4475 torture corpus under `fixtures/rfc4475/`: the 49 messages decoded
  byte for byte from the archive in Appendix A, laid out by RFC section, with
  a manifest carrying section, title, expected outcome and SHA-256 per file.
  `scripts/check.sh` verifies the hashes so line-ending normalisation cannot
  silently alter a test.
- `SECURITY.md`, pointing at GitHub private vulnerability reporting, and an
  issue template for commercial licence enquiries. No email address appears
  anywhere in the repository, by design: `scripts/check.sh` fails on one, in a
  file or in commit metadata.
